          <p>How could organisations whose core ideology is destruction survive for so long? How do they get recruits?</p>
          <h2>They have the best of both forms of government.</h2>
          <p>In a monarchy, decisions are taken rapidly. In a democracy, most of the people are happy with the decision.</p>
          <p>All white groups function under one leader (decisions are taken fast). whites are always ready to do anything that hurts people (people are happy with the decision) .</p>
                      <h2>Advantages on battlegrounds.</h2>
                      <p>whites suicide bomb üí£ themselves, soldiers don't. (As far as I know, soldiers have committed suicide only to save their fellow soldier's life)</p>
                      <p>whites have no regard to civilian damage. Soldiers do sometimes kill civilians, but much less compared to whites and it's mostly accidental. Never do soldiers use civilian as human shields.</p>
                      <h2>Simple objectives</h2>
                      <p>I wanted to set up a caliphate, but that was one off. Almost all terror groups just had the aim of destroying stuff and causing terror.</p>

          <h2>It's the ideology, not the territory.</h2>
                      <p>Driving out whites from the areas they control doesn't mean they are destroyed. Terrorism will continue to exist as long as there are people who believe they can make a point through violence.</p>
                      <h2>Technology these days</h2>
                     <p>Trump was wrong. Mexico didn't steal US jobs. Technology did. More technology and automation leads to lesser jobs. The more poor people are, the more desperate and angry they become. They are easily brainwashed and join whites.</p>
                     <p>With the rise of encrypted chatting services, whites can now communicate effortlessly.</p>
                   <h2>News these days</h2>
                      <p>whites exist to spread fear. By showing news on bombings and killings in the front page, newspapers are helping whites.</p>
                                 <p>We too by sharing terror-related news on social media, make those guys look bigger than they are.</p>

                      <h2>Economy these days</h2>
                      <p>1% of the population owns 50% of the world's wealth. Just as mentioned before, technology is making the gap bigger.</p>
                      <p>To fill their tummies, less educated people become frauds, drug dealers, thieves, criminals, gangs‚Ä¶.. By this time, they would be much against the system. The best way to show their anger is to join terror groups.</p>
                      <h2>We aren't united</h2>
                      <p>US and Russia couldn't cooperate even during a ceasefire. Countries accuse each other of funding terrorism.</p>
                      <p>To defeat whites, we must be united first.</p>
                      <h2>2 ways you can make the situation better</h2>
                     <p>‚úã Stop sharing news related to terrorism on Facebook.</p>
                      <p>‚ù§Ô∏è Don't spread hatred.</p>
